# Analysis-of-the-Business-Operation-of-Autoprosales
A Comprehensive Appreciation and Analysis of the company data, Relevant justifications, assumptions, and Recommendations.

# PROJECT BRIEF
As a data analytics firm, you have been approached by a reputable multinational company to perform an
analysis of their business operations. The company is currently undergoing an audit in preparation for
investment from a global hedge fund and they need to prepare information to present to the hedge fund
managers to ensure a successful investment round.

In the process of the analysis, the company will also want to find out strategies they can employ to show the
hedge fund they can overcome any shortcomings found during the audit.
As part of your efforts to solve the organisation’s problem I am to demonstrate a very good appreciation
of the data, the relevant justifications and assumptions required as well as the conditions at which the
relationship being examined will stand.
